                <span class="pink-text">Secret Combination Game</span> is a two-player logical crack-the-code game. Each
                player must find
                the right sequence of 4 symbols which was set by the other player. Players get 7 guesses each to find
                the
                right sequence. For each try, player gets the information about how many of the symbols were guessed
                right and
                placed on the correct position (<span class="red-text">red block</span>) and how many of the symbols
                were guessed right,
                but on the wrong position (<span class="yellow-text">yellow block</span>).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following example it is indicated that three of the symbols were guessed right, two of which
                placed
                on the right position and one on the wrong:

            <p>
                Before the game starts, players set up the combination of 4 symbols from a set of 6 distinct symbols for
                each other.
                Repetition is allowed. When both of the players finish setting up the combination, the game can start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player has 60 seconds to find the right combination. As the game flows, players take turns guessing
                their combination
                by choosing 4 out of the set of 6 symbols. After getting the information about how successful his
                guess
                was,
                the player's timer pauses and the other player continues with his turn. The winner is the first
                player
                who finds the right combination. If neither of the players finds the right combination after the 7th
                try,
                the game is a draw.
                If the time runs out for one of the players, the player who still has time left wins.
