Two-player logical crack-the-code game.

Secret Combination Game is a two-player logical crack-the-code game. Each player must find the right sequence of 4 symbols which was set by the other player. Players get 7 guesses each to find the right sequence. For each try, player gets the information about how many of the symbols were guessed right and placed on the correct position (red block) and how many of the symbols were guessed right, but on the wrong position (yellow block).

In the following example it is indicated that three of the symbols were guessed right, two of which placed on the right position and one on the wrong:

Before the game starts, players set up the combination of 4 symbols from a set of 6 distinct symbols for each other. Repetition is allowed. When both of the players finish setting up the combination, the game can start.

Each player has 60 seconds to find the right combination. As the game flows, players take turns guessing their combination by choosing 4 out of the set of 6 symbols. After getting the information about how successful his guess was, the player's timer pauses and the other player continues with his turn. The winner is the first player who finds the right combination. If neither of the players finds the right combination after the 7th try, the game is a draw. If the time runs out for one of the players, the player who still has time left wins.
